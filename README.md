# SLAP (Just a Proof of Concept / Idea right now)

SLAP visualizes the pitch of your voice in real time. It stops visualizing
automatically when you stop speaking to allow you to take a look at the graph.
Currently it is not accurate. It just computes a
[FFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform) and highlights the
loudest frequency. It would be useful for practicing the pronunciation of
pitch-accent or tonal languages once I find time to implement a proper
pitch-detection algorithm.
